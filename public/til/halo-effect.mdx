## Today I Learned…

That Halo effect is a cognitive bias that distorts the way as a person sees something or someone. This effect makes that given that the person sees a positive characteristic in this something or someone, she ends up attributing positive preconceptions to other characteristics, even if she has no evidence for it or vice versa.

The Halo effect (sometimes called the halo error) is the proclivity for positive impressions of a person, company, country, brand, or product in one area to positively influence one's opinion or feelings. The Halo effect is "the name given to the phenomenon whereby evaluators tend to be influenced by their previous judgments of performance or personality." The Halo effect is a cognitive bias which can prevent someone from forming an image of a person, a product or a brand based on the sum of all objective circumstances at hand.[^1]

This concept is used intentionally in marketing, for example, so that a product is associated with a celebrity or a successful event, so that the product is seen positively.

People are extremely susceptible to the Halo effect and usually attribute an opinion about something based on this effect and not on concrete evidence.

Cognitive bias is a pattern in perception, interpretation, or judgment that consistently leads to an individual misunderstanding something about themselves or their social environment, leading to poor decision-making or irrational behavior. The Halo effect is classified as a cognitive bias because the Halo effect is a perception error that distorts the way a person sees someone, and cognitive bias is a perception error that distorts the way that people see themselves.[^2]
