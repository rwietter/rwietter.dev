## Today I Learned…

That the prefix "synth-" derives from the Greek "synthesis", meaning "putting together" or "composition." In the context of machine learning (ML) and image generation, it implies the assembly of visual elements through artificial means rather than the direct capture of reality. The suffix "-graph" retains its original implication of writing or drawing. Thus, "synthography" might be understood as "drawing or creating through synthesis."

[...] This isn't mere semantics. Photography—from photo- “light” + -graph “something written”—means drawing with light onto something¹. You cannot “photograph” something that never existed. No photons were recorded because no moment actually happened. What she's doing might be art, ML image generation, or what some call “synthography.” Yet, it cannot, by definition, be photography.[^1]
