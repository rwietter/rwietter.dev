### Introduction

Hello ðŸ‘‹

Today we're going to discuss unidirectional and bidirectional flows in Next.js. By default, in React, data flows in one direction: from *owner* to *child*, i.e., unidirectional flow. However, sometimes we need to access a specific function or perform a state change in a *child* component from the *owner* component, i.e., bidirectionally, exposing data from the lower component to the higher one.

To solve this, we can lift the state (*Lifting State Up*) of a *child* component to an *owner* component, which will contain the *child* component's logic. Another way is to use the *Context API* or another global state manager for state sharing.  But we can also expose a function or state to the *owner* component through the `useImperativeHandle` hook and the `useRef` hook, passing the property reference to the *owner* component. Let's see how this works.

As the React documentation states regarding the `useImperativeHandle` hook:

<Cite>
The `useImperativeHandle` hook customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using `ref`. As always, imperative code using refs should be avoided in most cases.
</Cite>

And regarding the `useRef` hook:

<Cite>
`useRef` returns a mutable `ref` object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (`initialValue`). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.
</Cite>

In other words, the `useRef` hook creates a mutable object that receives an initial value which we can change during the component's lifecycle. The `useImperativeHandle` hook will help us expose our property to the parent component imperatively using this reference.

### Let's move on to a practical example

Let's start by creating an app with the *Next.js* framework. Run the commands below in your terminal to create the project, then navigate into the directory and run the application.

```shell
# create the project
yarn create next-app --typescript

# enter the created directory
cd my-app

# compile and run the project at http://localhost:3000
yarn dev
```

Project created! Now, let's go to `index.tsx` in `/pages/index.tsx` and remove the unnecessary code, leaving it as in the example below.

```tsx
import type { NextPage } from 'next'

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div> </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

Let's create our `Modal` component. Create a `components` directory in the project root, and inside it, a `modal` directory and create an `index.tsx` file. Inside the modal component, add a `label` and an `input` with the logic to open the modal when the state is true (*Short Circuit Evaluation*).

```tsx
// components/modal/index.tsx
import { useState } from "react";

const Modal: React.FC = () => {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
    {isModalOpen && (
      <div className="modal">
        <label htmlFor="nome">What is your name?</label>
        <input name="nome" />
      </div>
    )}
  </>
)};

export default Modal;
```

Let's import the `Modal` into the `Home` component and add a button below it that will trigger an event when clicked. This event needs to change the modal's state to `true` so that it is displayed on the screen. Therefore, we need to reference the function that changes the modal's state to the `Home` component.

```tsx
import Modal from '../components/modal'
import type { NextPage } from 'next'

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <Modal />
      <button onClick={() => {}} className="open-modal-button">
        Open Modal
      </button>
  </main>
)}

export default Home
```

Before that, let's add some styling to the modal. Create a style file `styles/modal.css`; this style will position the modal over other elements, center its components, and add a width and height. You can copy the CSS from this [link](https://github.com/rwietter/blog-posts/blob/main/my-app/styles/modal.css).

In the `global.css` style, add the code below to center the content.

```css
/* styles/global.css */
main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

Now, just import the `modal.css` file into `pages/_app.tsx`. This way, the style will already be applied to our `Modal` component.

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import '../styles/globals.css';
import '../styles/modal.css';
```

Now we need to do the reverse flow; we will reference the function that will change the state so that the *owner* component can access it. In the modal, we need to receive the reference that will be created in the *owner* component; this reference is obtained as the second parameter. We will also add the **type** to our parameters with *generic types*. We will also expose the `handleOpenModal` function with the `useImperativeHandle` hook. Its first argument receives the reference created in the *owner*, and the second argument is a *callback* that will return an object with our function that we want to access through the reference created in the *owner*. Finally, we will export the component as an argument to the `forwardRef` function; this function will forward the reference to the *owner* component.

```tsx
import {
  forwardRef,
  ForwardRefRenderFunction,
  ReactNode,
  useImperativeHandle,
  useState,
} from "react";

interface ModalProps {
  children?: ReactNode;
}

export interface ModalRef {
  handleOpenModal: () => void;
}


const Modal: ForwardRefRenderFunction<ModalRef, ModalProps> = (props, ref) => {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);

  const handleOpenModal = () => setIsModalOpen((state) => !state);

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    handleOpenModal,
  }));

  // ...
  return (
    <></>
  )
}

export default forwardRef(Modal);
```

Now, in the `Home` component, we need to create the `ref` and pass it to the modal component. We use the `useRef` hook to create a `ref` and pass the `ModalRef` interface as a *generic type*, which specifies the function we will reference. Export this interface and import it into the Modal component, as we need to add the *type* we receive as a component attribute.

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { ModalRef } from '../components/modal/index';
import Modal from '../components/modal'
import type { NextPage } from 'next'


const Home: NextPage = () => {
  const modalRef = useRef<ModalRef>(null);

  return (
    <>
      <Modal ref={modalRef} />
      <button onClick={() => {}}>Open Modal</button>
    </>
  )
}

export default Home;
```

Still in the `Home` component, we just need to create a function that will receive the function reference from the `Modal` and pass it to the `onClick` property. Once this is done, we will have a functional modal.

```tsx
// ... other imports

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  const modalRef = useRef<ModalRef>(null);
  const handleOpenModal = () => modalRef.current?.handleOpenModal();

  return (
    <>
      <Modal ref={modalRef} />
      <button onClick={handleOpenModal}>Open Modal</button>
    </>
  )
}

export default Home;
```

Finally, let's add a `close` button in the modal to close it when it's open.

```tsx
return (
  <>
  {isModalOpen && (
      <div className="modal">
      <label htmlFor="nome">What is your name?</label>
      <input name="nome" />
      <button onClick={handleOpenModal}>Close</button>
      </div>
    )}
  </>
);
```

### Conclusion

This is a simple way to change a state when we can't or don't want to create the logic for a feature in a component that doesn't need to know about this feature, or when we don't want to use a state manager.  It's not very common, nor is it recommended to use imperative code, but it can be very useful when necessary :)
