In 2024, I read some amazing books.

## Dune

I knew Dune in a Movie released in 2021 (Dune: Part One), so at finished the movie I was fascinated by the Dune Universe. So I decided to read the book. And I was not disappointed. The book is amazing, and the movie is very faithful to the book. I recommend it to everyone.

Dune is a complex universe in a distant future where humans are divided into different houses, and the spice is the most valuable substance in the universe. Houses are subordinated to the Emperor, and the Emperor is a man guided by calculated power.

The house Atreides is a big house and your power challenges the Emperor. The Atreides are sent to Arrakis by the Emperor instead of the house Harkonnen. But this is a trap to exterminate house atreides.

But in this universe, has entities called Bene Gesserit: a order of witches that act on the shadows to manipulate the empire. The Bene Gesserit have a plan to create a superhuman, the Kwisatz Haderach. And the Kwisatz Haderach is the son of Jessica, the concubine of the Duke Leto Atreides.

The plan o Emperor to exterminate house atreides works and the Duke Leto is killed, but Paul Atreides, the son of Leto and Jessica, survives and becomes a leader of the Fremen, the natives of Arrakis.

Paul needs to fight in Arrakis to gain confidence of the Fremen. In you journey, framens become faithful with Paul because Bene Gesserit spread a manipulated story to fremen saying that one day Lisan al-Gaib (the voice from the outer world) will come to free fremen from the Harkonnen and the Emperor and leds fremen to paradise. This is part of Bene Gesserit's plan to create a Kwisatz Haderach.
