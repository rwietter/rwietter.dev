<Micro title="Chaos Theory" date="2024-07-24">
The chaos is NOT the opposite of organization, but of simplicity[^1] i.e., in the midst of chaos there is organization, but there is no simplicity. This organization can be observed in chaotic attractors, which are regions in phase space where the chaotic system converges. This means that, although the behavior of the chaotic system is chaotic and unpredictable in general, there are still some organized structure within the system.

> “You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star.” — Friedrich Nietzsche
