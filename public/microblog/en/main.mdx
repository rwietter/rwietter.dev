<Micro title="The Origin of the Beast" date="2024-10-27">
What defines a person? There are many answers to this, of course, but I assert that it is shaped by one's entire lived experience—from birth up to the present moment. Throughout this period, an individual absorbs information from various sources, with no two people consuming the same content or drawing identical conclusions. Each person, therefore, develops a unique semantic framework.

This personal semantics forms an individual's values and influences their beliefs or disbeliefs. While this discussion could be significantly expanded, my intention here is to draw a parallel to how people perceive politics, particularly those who genuinely uphold and care about their values.

Given this, we can observe that individuals devoid of substantial content are often easily manipulated by populist movements on both the far right and far left. Today, it has become even more apparent how large masses of people—lacking substance and driven by extremist rhetoric—have gained prominence and power in the political arena. This phenomenon brings to mind a famous quote by Friedrich Nietzsche in his book Twilight of the Idols: "The weak always end up dominating the strong—for they are the greater number."[^5] Here, "weak" refers to those devoid of meaningful content, while "strong" signifies individuals with substance and values.

These movements are devoid of true knowledge; they rely on (1) fear of social change, often employing religion as a means of control; (2) the use of simple slogans and acronyms that are easily remembered, targeting an uninformed electorate; and (3) the creation of enemies to assert themselves as a superior, "pure" race, directing hostility towards immigrants, minorities, scientists, academics, and journalists.

Moreover, such movements tend to project their own flaws and ailments onto their adversaries, attributing to them what is essentially a reflection of their own weaknesses. They attempt to appear strong by wielding weapons rather than intellect, ultimately embodying a sickly beast.

<Micro title="Introspection" date="2024-10-13">
Introspection—society often perceives introspective individuals as mentally ill or socially dysfunctional. There is a tendency to "improve" them, to mold them into what is considered normal. However, what these so-called normal people fail to understand is that the introspective individual finds pleasure in solitude; for them, solitude is valuable, a space for self-knowledge, reflection, and inner peace. In this sense, an introspective person may be physically alone but not feel lonely. Furthermore, the introspective individual does not enjoy being surrounded by people whose presence lacks value; true companionship is rare and meaningful — it is characterized by a deep connection, the exchange of ideas, or mutual understanding where those involved are genuinely interested in the relationship. This introspective person despises superficial or empty company that fails to provide such quality interaction, merely disturbing their state of solitude[^3]. Therefore, to "cure" the introspective person is to weaken and make them vulnerable, depriving them of their inner strength and wisdom[^4].

[^3]: “My solitude doesn’t depend on the presence or absence of people; on the contrary, I hate who steals my solitude without, in exchange, offering me true company.” ― Friedrich Nietzsche.

<Micro title="Interstellar Gravity" date="2024-09-12">
Some people refer to the tesseract in Interstellar as a library, but this does not do justice to the concept. The tesseract is a three-dimensional representation of a four-dimensional space within a five-dimensional reality, allowing for physical interaction with time through gravity. What bothers me is that this representation is sustained by "love," which, in the film, is treated as a metaphorical force that transcends dimensional limitations. In other words, future humans lack a direct connection to past humans, necessitating Cooper's intervention to create this bridge. Thus, due to this relationship that transcends dimensions, the tesseract behaves as a "light cone" of events related to Murph, enabling Cooper to interact with her.

Another important aspect is that the film's events form a circular causality cycle. Who sends the messages: Cooper, or do the messages send Cooper? The answer is both. Closed timelike curves[^2], as predicted by the equations of general relativity, suggest such a scenario. In theory, this would be possible if time is treated as a physical dimension in which the past, present, and future coexist and interact in ways that challenge our linear notion of causality.

<Micro title="Chaos Theory" date="2024-07-24">
The chaos is NOT the opposite of organization, but of simplicity[^1] i.e., in the midst of chaos there is organization, but there is no simplicity. This organization can be observed in chaotic attractors, which are regions in phase space where the chaotic system converges. This means that, although the behavior of the chaotic system is chaotic and unpredictable in general, there are still some organized structure within the system.

> “You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star.” — Friedrich Nietzsche

<Micro title="The Simple Architecture" date="2024-08-26">
Any contemporary software architecture is crafted to segregate business logic and the key components from the underlying infrastructure and external libraries. This ensures that the core remains agnostic to any frameworks or external dependencies. The specific choice of architecture matters less, as long as it achieves this separation; prioritize simplicity in your solution.
