<Micro title="Principles: The Foundation of Morality" date="2025-03-09">
Nothing evokes greater disdain in me than the depravity of those devoid of any principles, those who blindly submit to the will of others, relinquishing their capacity to assess the repercussions of their actions or critically examine the underlying consequences of their positions. These individuals transcend mere lack of autonomy; they are mere phantoms, existing in intellectual servitude, reduced to passive followers of a collective mindset, too timid to engage in independent thought.

<Micro title="The Origin of the Beast" date="2024-10-27">
What defines a person? There are many possible answers to this question, but one could argue that it is the entirety of their lived experience—that is, everything they have encountered from birth to the present moment. Along this journey, they absorb content from a variety of sources, and since no two individuals engage with the exact same references or draw identical conclusions, each person develops a unique semantic framework.  

This personal semantics shapes an individual’s values and influences what they believe or reject. This discussion can be explored from numerous perspectives, but the purpose here is to draw a parallel with how people perceive politics, particularly those who possess well-established values and actively care about them.  

In this regard, **intellectually impoverished individuals** tend to be more easily manipulated by populist rhetoric, whether from the far right or the far left. In contemporary society, this phenomenon has become even more apparent, as vast groups of **citizens susceptible to manipulation**, often embracing extremist discourse, gain visibility and political influence. This observation recalls a well-known remark by Friedrich Nietzsche in *Twilight of the Idols*, in which he states: "[...] the weak have always had to dominate the strong, not out of any intention or by any means of theirs but simply because of their numbers"[^5]. In this context, "the weak" can be interpreted as those lacking critical substance, whereas "the strong" represent individuals that prioritize their own and intrinsic values and principles.

Such movements are devoid of solid foundations and typically rely on three primary pillars: (1) fear of social change, often reinforced by the instrumentalisation of religion as a tool of control; (2) the use of short, easily memorable slogans and acronyms, fully aware that their target audience tends towards intellectual superficiality; and (3) the fabrication of enemy figures to construct an illusion of superiority—typically minorities, immigrants, scientists, academics, and journalists.  

Moreover, these movements frequently project their own weaknesses onto their opponents, attributing to them characteristics that, in reality, reflect their own deficiencies. In their attempt to appear strong, they replace rationality with aggression, resorting to violence as an instrument of power—an evident display of intellectual fragility and decline.

<Micro title="Introspection" date="2024-10-13">
Introspection—society often perceives introspective individuals as mentally ill or socially dysfunctional. There is a tendency to "improve" them, to mold them into what is considered normal. However, what these so-called normal people fail to understand is that the introspective individual finds pleasure in solitude; for them, solitude is valuable, a space for self-knowledge, reflection, and inner peace. In this sense, an introspective person may be physically alone but not feel lonely. Furthermore, the introspective individual does not enjoy being surrounded by people whose presence lacks value; true companionship is rare and meaningful — it is characterized by a deep connection, the exchange of ideas, or mutual understanding where those involved are genuinely interested in the relationship. This introspective person despises superficial or empty company that fails to provide such quality interaction, merely disturbing their state of solitude[^3]. Therefore, to "cure" the introspective person is to weaken and make them vulnerable, depriving them of their inner strength and wisdom[^4].

[^3]: “My solitude doesn’t depend on the presence or absence of people; on the contrary, I hate who steals my solitude without, in exchange, offering me true company.” ― Friedrich Nietzsche.

<Micro title="Interstellar Gravity" date="2024-09-12">
Some people refer to the tesseract in Interstellar as a library, but this does not do justice to the concept. The tesseract is a three-dimensional representation of a four-dimensional space within a five-dimensional reality, allowing for physical interaction with time through gravity. What bothers me is that this representation is sustained by "love," which, in the film, is treated as a metaphorical force that transcends dimensional limitations. In other words, future humans lack a direct connection to past humans, necessitating Cooper's intervention to create this bridge. Thus, due to this relationship that transcends dimensions, the tesseract behaves as a "light cone" of events related to Murph, enabling Cooper to interact with her.

Another important aspect is that the film's events form a circular causality cycle. Who sends the messages: Cooper, or do the messages send Cooper? The answer is both. Closed timelike curves[^2], as predicted by the equations of general relativity, suggest such a scenario. In theory, this would be possible if time is treated as a physical dimension in which the past, present, and future coexist and interact in ways that challenge our linear notion of causality.

<Micro title="Chaos Theory" date="2024-07-24">
The chaos is NOT the opposite of organization, but of simplicity[^1] i.e., in the midst of chaos there is organization, but there is no simplicity. This organization can be observed in chaotic attractors, which are regions in phase space where the chaotic system converges. This means that, although the behavior of the chaotic system is chaotic and unpredictable in general, there are still some organized structure within the system.

> “You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star.” — Friedrich Nietzsche

<Micro title="The Simple Architecture" date="2024-08-26">
Any contemporary software architecture is crafted to segregate business logic and the key components from the underlying infrastructure and external libraries. This ensures that the core remains agnostic to any frameworks or external dependencies. The specific choice of architecture matters less, as long as it achieves this separation; prioritize simplicity in your solution.
